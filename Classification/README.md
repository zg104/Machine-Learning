# Classification

Classification is a form of supervised learning where the response variable is categorical, as opposed to numeric for regression. Our goal is to find a rule, algorithm, or function which takes as input a feature vector, and outputs a category which is the true category as often as possible.

We will talk about visualization for classification amd metrics.
